<p>This block estimates the average convective heat transfer coefficient for free convection within concentric spheres for either the inner or outer surface. The employed correlation is the work of Raithby and Hollands.<p>
<p>G. D. Raithby and K. G. T. Hollands, "A General Method of Obtaining Approximate Solutions to Laminar and Turbulent Free Convection Problems," in T. F. Irvine and J. P. Harnett, Eds., Advances in Heat Transfer, Vol. 11, Academic Press. New York, 1975. pp. 265-315.<p>
<p>Raithby and Hollands express the heat transfer between the inner and outer surfaces with an effiective thermal conductivity: <p>
$$
Q = \frac{4 \pi k_{eff} \left( T_{i} - T_{o} \right)}{1/r_i - 1/r_o}
$$
<p>where<p>
$$
r_i = inner \: radius, \: r_o = outer \: radius,
$$
$$
T_i = temperature \: of \: inner \: surface, \: T_o = temperature \: of \: outer \: surface,
$$
$$
k_{eff} = effective \: thermal \: conductivity, Q = heat \: transfer
$$
<p>The suggested correlation for the effective thermal conductivity is:<p>
$$
\frac{k_{eff}}{k} = 0.74 \left( \frac{Pr}{0.861 + Pr} \right)^{1/4} Ra^{1/4}
$$
<p>k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, Pr is the Prandtl number, and Ra is the Rayliegh number. The characteristic length for Ra is given by:<p>
$$
L = \frac{\left( 1/r_i - 1/r_o \right)^{4/3}}{2^{1/3} \left( r_i^{-7/5} + r_o^{-7/5} \right)^{5/3}}
$$
<p>The average convective heat transfer coefficient is:<p>
$$
h = \frac{ k_{eff} }{ r^2 \: \left( 1/r_i - 1/r_o \right) }
$$
<p>where r is the radius of the surface of interest whether it be the inner or outer surface. The heat flux (q) would then be:<p>
$$
q = h \left( T_i - T_o \right)
$$
<p>The equation used to predict the effective thermal conductivity is valid for the following ranges:<p>
$$
0.7 \leq Pr \leq 4000
$$
$$
Ra \leq 10^4
$$
<p>Also note that if k_{eff} is less than k then k_{eff} is set equal to k to enforce that the heat transfer be greater than or equal to the heat transfer due to conduction alone.<p>
<p>All fluid properrties should be evaluated at average of the hot and cold surfaces.<p>
<p>This block is capable of performing multiple calculations given 1-D arrays of consistent size for the inputs and parameters. The units of inputs and paramters may very but they must be consistent. The units of the output will be dependent on the units of the inputs and parameters.<p>
