<font size="6" color="Magenta">2-D Transient Conduction Model - Fully Implicit (Iterative Subsystem Capable) Library Block</font>
<br>
<p>This block is identical to the block <a href="Conduction_TSAT_2DCondFullImplicit.html">2-D Transient Conduction Model - Fully Implicit</a> other than a slight modification to make it compatible for use within an iterative subsystem. The memory block which holds the temperature state in <a href="Conduction_TSAT_2DCondFullImplicit.html">2-D Transient Conduction Model - Fully Implicit</a> is troublesome for use inside iterative subsystems because as the subsystem iterates the temperature solution will move forward in time while the model outside of the iterative subsystem remains at the same time-step. This can cause inconsistent and erroneous results, particularly for transients. To resolve this issue, the memory block should be moved outside of the block. This allows the temperature matrix to be routed outside of the iterative subsystem into a memory block and then back into the iterative subsystem and into this block as an input. This will effectively provide the temperature solution from the previous iteraiton as an input. Because the memory block has been removed from inside the block the responsibility is on the user to define the initial temperature state in the memory block that is placed outside of the iterative subsystem.<p>
